# Roadmap

#### In ambito Hosts

* [X] Try bloc;
* [X] Try to generate a listview with details taken from cubit state
* [X] Test the state management with a function that spawns fake terminals
* [X] "Precise" navigation to terminals through bottom navigation drawer
* [ ] Side sheet for "quick" navigation
* [X] True terminals
* [ ] Menu for adding a new Host
* [ ] Store and load hosts from memory
* [ ] if override acceptKeyStroke=true, arrow key up is listened by both the terminal and Android, which moves focus away from the terminal. Try to wrap terminal into a Fokus (onKey: )
